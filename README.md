## Overview
All hashes are in base 58 so that they can be inserted in the blockchain

##### Refill Wallet
The refill wallet is only used to refill the Federation Wallet with 10000 and 600 satoshi outputs.
This way we maintain the Federation Wallet clean which makes it easier to manage.

##### Federation Wallet
The Federation wallet is the wallet from where all the registers in the blockchain occur.
We can check the validity of transactions by looking at the origin of this transactions and
see if the originating address belongs to a federation. For instance all pieces registered through
[ascribe.io](https://www.ascribe.io/) will originate from the address `1JttRRdtAi6cDNM23Uq4BEU61R8kJeANJs` 
for the first version of the protocol or `1AScRhqdXMrJyxNmjEapMZi1PLFsqmLquG` for protocol version `01`.

The Federation wallet should only contain fuel outputs with the amount of 10000 satoshi and token outputs
with the amount of 600 satoshi. The fuel is used to pay the fee for the transactions and tokens are used
to register address on the blockchain.

Ensuring that the Federation wallet cointains outputs with these amounts makes the transactions simpler 
since there is no need for change. It is also easier to keep track of the unspents in order to prevent 
invalid transactions due to double spends (specially important when there is a high throughput of 
transactions).

## Example
All the addresses and transaction ids outputed by this examples can be checked in the blockchain.

```
For this example we will be implementing the following actions:

1. Refill Federation wallet with fuel and tokens
2. user1 registers master edition
3. user1 registers number of editions
4. user1 registers edition number 1
5. user1 transferes edition number 1 to user2
6. user2 consigns edition number 1 to user 3
7. user3 unconsigns edition number 1 to user2
8. user2 loans edition number 1 to user 3

This is the information that we will need:
refill_pass:     <refill wallet password>
federation_pass: <federation wallet password>
user1_pass:      <user1 password>
user2_pass:      <user2 password>
user3_pass:      <user 3 password>
refill_root:     ('', u'mhyCaF2HFk7CVwKmyQ8TahgVdjnHSr1pTv')
federation_root: ('', u'mqXz83H4LCxjf2ie8hYNsTRByvtfV43Pa7')
user1_root:      ('', u'n36EiKuYYXNS9h84CnkLK3sEevZsfksaGN') -> root address for user1 HD wallet
user1_leaf:      ('2015/5/28/9/28/44/982190', u'mjq4rZZEyJGFfzg59RLFmuNJTo3jakEDrS') -> leaf address for user1 HD wallet
user2_leaf:      ('2015/5/28/9/28/45/184623', u'mhRJqLG3BwXXG7YADQD3Ng3c6coZVwoFo6') -> leaf address for user2 HD wallet
user3_leaf:      ('2015/5/28/9/28/45/387493', u'mhMXXntQCorduhcygY7gLdmuunVEM59C8q') -> leaf address for user3 HD wallet
file_hash :      (u'mhXeWEMLnEwVNnyqKrqUDPAYSuwhfyNXA7', u'mzQxP43Y4A6PfYeArV2mGBEucJfDtsyCk5') -> file_hash file_hash+metadata
```

Before we can start with spool transactions we need to have a Federation
with all the necessary fuel and tokens.
```python
from spool import Spool

spool = Spool(testnet=True)

# lets refill the federation wallet with necessary fuel*7 and tokens*11 for this example
txid = spool.refill_main_wallet(refill_root, federation_root[1], 7, 11,
                                refill_pass, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
67d22e66ee46a96e94f08bed0c857f23de39aee8b25db5fa0369c495e072e44c
```
[67d22e66ee46a96e94f08bed0c857f23de39aee8b25db5fa0369c495e072e44c](https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/tx/67d22e66ee46a96e94f08bed0c857f23de39aee8b25db5fa0369c495e072e44c)

Now that we have enough funds in the Federation wallet user1 can ascribe its master edition.
A master edition its a register with edition number 0 that ascribes the piece to user1 making him the
original owner/creator of the piece. Master editions are ascribed to the user's root address of the HD wallet
```python
# user1 registers the master edition of piece with file_hash
txid = spool.register(federation_root, user1_root[1], file_hash,
                      federation_pass, 0, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
f67aa26b5f47e83124040970246c969d04ec9adecc5a97d60754a0f54355ee81
```
[f67aa26b5f47e83124040970246c969d04ec9adecc5a97d60754a0f54355ee81](https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/tx/f67aa26b5f47e83124040970246c969d04ec9adecc5a97d60754a0f54355ee81)

Now that user1 has registered the master edition he can now specify how many editions of the piece will exist.
user1 can only do this once and this cannot be changed in the future. This creates digital scarcity for this 
particular piece
```python
# user1 specifies that there will be 10 editions of the piece with hash file_hash
txid = spool.editions(federation_root, user1_root, file_hash,
                      federation_pass, 10, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
f1f2cdf6ef2ee2d8af13f9d45a1fd7700f9f281078c71939f78326a4b6b957dc
```
[f1f2cdf6ef2ee2d8af13f9d45a1fd7700f9f281078c71939f78326a4b6b957dc](https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/tx/f1f2cdf6ef2ee2d8af13f9d45a1fd7700f9f281078c71939f78326a4b6b957dc)

Once the number of editions is registered user1 can now start registering editions so that he can
transfer ownership to other users. Each edition is registered to a different leaf address of user1 
HD wallet
```python
# user1 registers edition number 1 of piece with file_hash
txid = spool.register(federation_root, user1_leaf[1], file_hash,
                      federation_pass, 1, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
2376a200a326ee7cf87b7fee7ea0f9a80c8b23cc3a0d72732b9a75517e664f23
```
[2376a200a326ee7cf87b7fee7ea0f9a80c8b23cc3a0d72732b9a75517e664f23](https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/tx/2376a200a326ee7cf87b7fee7ea0f9a80c8b23cc3a0d72732b9a75517e664f23)

Now that and edition is registered the user can transfer ownership to another user.
Transfering ownserhip implies a transaction originating from user1 wallet address holding the edition. 
This means that we need to fuel user1 wallet with the necessary funds before performing a spool 
transaction
```python
# refill user1 wallet before transfer
txid = spool.refill(federation_root, user1_leaf[1], 1, 1,
                    federation_pass, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
45bc2a3eecac9b5538a3b5bc325e94fcffee47c0025e78ece426aeebfac59c24

# now we can transfer ownserhip of edition 1 from user1 to user2
txid = spool.transfer(user1_leaf, user2_leaf[1], file_hash,
                      user1_pass, 1, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
38509a49b00f3c3c3fadedd2c5ce35ffcc05a9737a36dd1b7ff00ed1ffe5fd80
```
[45bc2a3eecac9b5538a3b5bc325e94fcffee47c0025e78ece426aeebfac59c24](https://www.blocktrail.com/tBTC/tx/45bc2a3eecac9b5538a3b5bc325e94fcffee47c0025e78ece426aeebfac59c24)

User2 now owns edition 1 of piece with hash file_hash and he can transfer ownership of the piece.
Lets consign the piece to user3
```python
# refill user2 wallet before consign
txid = spool.refill(federation_root, user2_leaf[1], 1, 1,
                    federation_pass, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
e07732c8af3557277f68871babc874766c511fdf898449cc9be9e505f8325f10

# now we can consign edition 1 from user2 to user3
txid = spool.consign(user2_leaf, user3_leaf[1], file_hash,
                     user2_pass, 1, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
3b30cea26d49eb023ccd62fb78ddd9308c9505fe0796abc0fe60989980fc5eb8

Now lets unconsign the piece with hash file_hash back to user2
```python
# refill user3 wallet before unconsign
txid = spool.refill(federation_root, user3_leaf[1], 1, 1,
                    federation_pass, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
f0c9cf0832e7ca14012e7379da35dd2d50bd66df45c2eb089a23b10db4047dcc

# user3 unconsigns edition number 1 back to user2
txid = spool.unconsign(user3_leaf, user2_leaf[1], file_hash,
                       user3_pass, 1, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid
11dcb46061526790e0e7cf0a83e9163d35b75461cd203858c1fd7bdb2149db0c
```

Now that user2 owns the edition again lets loan it to user3 from 15-05-22 to 15-05-23
```python
# refill user2 wallet before loan
txid = spool.refill(federation_root, user2_leaf[1], 1, 1,
                    federation_pass, min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid

# user2 loans edition number 1 to user3
txid = spool.loan(user2_leaf, user3_leaf[1], file_hash,
                  user2_pass, 1, '150522', '150523', min_confirmations=1, sync=True)
print txid

## Documentation

#### Spool

##### Spool(testnet=False)
Class that contains all Spool methods.

    In the SPOOL implementation there is no notion of users only addresses.
    All addresses come from BIP32 HD wallets. This makes it easier to manage all the keys
    since we can retrieve everything we need from a master secret (namely the private key
    to sign the transactions).

    Since we are dealing with HD wallets we expect all from_address to be a tuple of 
    (path, address) so that we can retrieve the private key for that particular 
    leaf address.
    If we want to use the root address we can just pass an empty string to the 
    first element of the tuple e.g. ('', address). For instance when using the 
    federation wallet address we have no need to create leaf addresses.

    A file is represented by two hashes:
        - file_hash: is the hash of the digital file
        - file_hash_metadata: is the hash of the digital file + metadata
    The hash is passed to the methods has a tuple (file_hash, file_hash_metadata)

## Testing
Run tests that require no transactions to be made in the bitcoin network
```bash
python -m unittest discover -v tests/
```

To run the tests for the spool protocol you need to provide the _REFILL_ and _FEDERATION_ 
wallet passwords. Note that these tests may take some time since we need to wait for the
bitcoin network to confirm each transaction. This will by default use tbtc.blockr.io
```bash
TEST_SPOOL=1 TEST_REFILL_PASS=<refill_pass> TEST_FEDERATION_PASS=<federation_pass> python -m unittest discover -v tests/
```

You can also test with bitcoind by using `TEST_SPOOL=2` and providing the `TESTNET_USERNAME`, `TESTNET_PASSWORD`, 
`TESTNET_HOST` and `TESTNET_PORT` environment variables to connect to the bitcoind rpc.


### Using Docker
You can use docker to run the tests for pyspool, or to work on pyspool.

To build the docker image:

```bash
docker build -t pyspool .
```

Simply running:

```bash
docker run --rm pyspool
```

will run the tests, without bitcoin network transactions.

You can also pass your own command, as in:

```bash
docker run --rm pyspool python -m unittest discover -v tests/
```
